<h5>13 Jan 2017</h5>

With my senior year of high school nearly half-way finished, now seems as good a time as any to start blogging. Writing has been extremely important to my career development so far, and I hope this blog will be a good place to continue to develop my written voice.

Of course, I will be writing about app development and technology, as these are the areas I am focusing on now and where I see myself in the future. However, I also want this blog to be a place for me to share other things I write. I think this would be good for me, but I also hope others can enjoy it as well.

My goal with this blog is to write once a month, minimum. The post may be about programming, tech companies, current events, or even fiction. Get something out there, and move on to something else.

I haven't decided yet if this will count as my January post. I guess we'll both find out by February 1.
