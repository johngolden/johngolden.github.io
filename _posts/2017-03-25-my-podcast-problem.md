<h5>25 Mar 2017</h5>

I am currently subscribed to 27 podcasts. Finding time to listen to all these podcasts is a challenge, especially considering that most of these podcasts come out on a weekly schedule.

Overcast makes it somewhat easier to manage, thanks to Smart Speed and the speed adjustments, but still, that is a lot of time to listen to people talk.

Here is my list of podcasts I listen to on a regular basis:

- 99% Invisible
- Accidental Tech Podcast
- Analog(ue)
- Canvas
- Core Intuition
- Clockwise
- Common Sense with Dan Carlin
- Connected
- Cortex
- Ctrl-Walt-Delete
- Do By Friday
- Exponent
- Face the Nation Diary
- Fatal Error
- Free Agents
- Happy Hour
- More Than Just Code
- Reconcilable Differences
- Release Notes
- Runtime
- Stuff You Should Know
- Swift Unwrapped
- The Talk Show With John Gruber
- Thoroughly Considered
- Under the Radar
- Ungeniused
- Upgrade

I have to cut back on which podcasts I listen to, because this is getting out of hand. Most likely, I'll decide which ones to cut using some of these criteria:

- _Do I remember what this podcast is about without looking at the description? Do I remember who the hosts are?_ If not, maybe I am not getting as much out of the show as I believed.
- _Is there anything I get from this podcast that I don't get from any other podcast?_ No point in listening to redundant content.
- _How much of a time commitment is the podcast?_ One hour a month is easy to justify. Two hours per week, on the other hand, is less so.
- _How invested am I in the podcast already?_ If I have only listened to a few episodes of a podcast so far, it would be easier to stop listening than it would be if I listened for a year or two already.

Even though I want to listen to all these podcasts, I need to get down to 20 podcasts so I don't have to always feel like listening to podcasts is another chore to do before next week's episodes come out. I enjoy listening to these shows, but when it gets laborious to listen to all of them, you know there's a problem.
